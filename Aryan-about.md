## About 

This project is part of my self-directed journey to understand how modern web applications are built and managed. I began by forking a Next.js starter project from GitHub, running it locally through Visual Studio Code and Node.js, and experimenting with changes to the source code. By editing the default files and replacing placeholder text with my own, I learned how small adjustments in React components instantly reflect in a live development server (localhost:3000).

Beyond coding, this exercise has taught me how GitHub workflows operate â€” the difference between cloning and forking, how commits document progress, and how README files turn raw code into a professional portfolio. Using VS Code extensions for JavaScript, React, and Git integration has also introduced me to the tools real developers rely on every day.


## Next Steps

While these edits may seem simple, they represent the foundation of my growth: learning to take an existing codebase, understand its structure, and extend it with my own ideas. My next steps are to experiment with CSS frameworks like Tailwind, create new pages, and eventually deploy projects online. This practice reflects my curiosity, adaptability, and determination to keep pushing into full-stack development.
