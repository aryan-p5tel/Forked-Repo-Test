# Practice Blog – Next.js Fork

This project is adapted from the [Next.js Blog Starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/blog-starter), with full allowance for educational and personal development purposes. It demonstrates my exploration into web development workflows, editing pre-existing code, and building personalized features.

## About This Project

I forked the original Next.js example and copied it into a new repository to work directly on a local version. Through this process, I have:

- Learned to **navigate and modify a large codebase**, identifying the correct files to edit.  
- Practiced **running local servers** using `npm run dev` to view changes in real time at `localhost:3000`.  
- Experimented with **Visual Studio Code extensions**, improving workflow and debugging efficiency.  
- Edited content and design elements, including text and basic layout, to personalize the website.  
- Gained familiarity with **version control** via Git, committing changes in a structured, professional manner.

This project reflects both **technical growth** and a **forward-thinking mindset**, demonstrating early fluency in web development practices and collaborative skills.

## Screenshots & Proof of Work

Below are screenshots showing the project running on `localhost:3000`:

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** – framework for building the project  
- **React** – component-based development  
- **VS Code** – IDE for editing and extensions  
- **npm** – package management and server control  
- **Git & GitHub** – version control and repository management

## Next Steps

Looking forward, I plan to continue refining this project to strengthen both technical and collaborative skills. Key next steps include:

- Enhancing website functionality and interactivity with additional React/Next.js components.
- Experimenting with advanced Tailwind styling and custom animations to improve UI/UX.
- Practicing debugging, error handling, and optimization techniques.
- Extending version control workflow with feature branches and pull requests to simulate team collaboration.
- Documenting changes systematically for future reference and showcasing progress on GitHub.

These steps aim to deepen my understanding of web development, build fluency in coding languages, and prepare for collaborative projects in professional and academic settings.
