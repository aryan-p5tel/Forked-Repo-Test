## Early development

My ambition is to become fluent in web development and comfortable working inside any codebase, whether it is my own project or a collaboration with others. A key part of this journey is learning how to identify exactly where changes need to be made â€” for example, by inspecting websites and connecting those insights to the right files in the project. I am also practicing the process of installing the correct VS Code extensions, refining my workflow so I can move faster and work more effectively in team environments.

 While this is still the early stage of my development, it is a strong starting point. Each edit, experiment, and improvement brings me closer to understanding modern website development in depth and preparing for future group projects, internships, and professional opportunities.
